1
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:28,255
Every world has ghosts.

2
00:01:29,173 --> 00:01:31,258
And every house is haunted by them.

3
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:35,721
Even the palace of the Empire.

4
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,558
Especially the palace of the Empire.

5
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:45,272
Where have you been?

6
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,274
With the systems programmers.

7
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:49,860
Lately you've been with
them more than with me.

8
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:52,529
You've set them a large task.

9
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,575
Should we look to replace them?

10
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:57,910
They'll see it through.

11
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:01,997
I can count on you, Demerzel?

12
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:04,416
To see it through?

13
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,126
Of course, Cleon.

14
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,419
And not just that.

15
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:09,755
Everything.

16
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,925
I always assumed you'd
stay on after I was gone.

17
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:17,554
But it occurred to me, in
the near-darkness of my life...

18
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:21,391
I shouldn't take anything for granted.

19
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,977
I'm loyal to the Empire.

20
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:27,689
Yes, but will the
Empire be loyal to you?

21
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,568
It hasn't always shown
benevolence to your kind.

22
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:35,489
You're becoming sentimental,
verging on maudlin.

23
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:38,784
Well, I'm dying.

24
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:42,955
And I'm leaving everything in pieces.

25
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:45,332
Are you unhappy with your successor?

26
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:50,420
We can still revisit the
idea of marriage and an heir.

27
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:55,884
Demerzel, for all you are,
and maybe because of it...

28
00:02:58,262 --> 00:02:59,721
there are things you will never know.

29
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,723
I may someday know death.

30
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:03,517
Yes.

31
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:07,020
But I doubt you will
feel it arrived too soon.

32
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:14,194
I should have seen the
completion of the Star Bridge.

33
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:19,658
Me. My mind. My eyes.

34
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:24,913
We should have ridden up
to the orbital platform together

35
00:03:24,997 --> 00:03:27,416
and looked down on
all that we had made.

36
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,127
And one day we will.

37
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,631
Your continuity is assured.

38
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,474
- Do you think of him often?
- You know the way I am.

39
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:48,478
I don't forget anything or anyone.

40
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:52,149
Empire is always on my mind.

41
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:55,986
The platform's orbit is
dying at an accelerated rate.

42
00:03:57,863 --> 00:04:01,533
Or so say the physicists, who
worry it'll just fall on their heads.

43
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:03,493
Their job is to worry
over those things.

44
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,078
Is it not ours?

45
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:13,921
Perhaps it is still yours,
but no longer mine,

46
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:16,673
as it is no longer his.

47
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,551
How you spend this
last day is up to you.

48
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,387
Every one of you is different.

49
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:25,265
Somehow I doubt that.

50
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:30,771
But thank you for trying to make me
feel unique as I shuffle off the stage.

51
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:37,194
It was hardest on him.

52
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:40,489
He only had the infant
Dawn to place on the throne.

53
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:42,741
A baby with his eyes.

54
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:48,664
Identical in every respect,
but a baby nonetheless.

55
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:52,251
When I think of him,
that's what I think.

56
00:04:53,836 --> 00:04:55,420
He also had you.

57
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:01,718
Please see Master Ilan, Empire.
He's waiting for your final fitting.

58
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,865
Shall we?

59
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,997
The details, they're perfect.

60
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:35,878
For the pick stitching?

61
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:37,504
The jade, I think.

62
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:46,013
Shoo, shoo.

63
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:58,442
I am sorry, Empire.

64
00:05:58,525 --> 00:05:59,776
I have lost weight.

65
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,987
- I am sure your frame is...
- I am shrinking.

66
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:05,824
The world is beginning
to see me from a distance.

67
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,244
The garment is singular, Ilan.

68
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:14,833
It will be a privilege to
wear it at my ascension.

69
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:17,002
Thank you, Empire.

70
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,796
- Shall we finish the job?
- Oh.

71
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:28,138
Ilan, let's let the
girl have the stage.

72
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:47,658
Brother Dusk? I didn't
know you'd be here.

73
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:55,249
Anacreon. Thespis.

74
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,918
I wonder if you will speak
of them after I'm gone.

75
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:00,754
We have broken the
barbarians. Cast them adrift.

76
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:03,924
What would you have us
say that you haven't said?

77
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:08,262
I don't know. I'm still trying to
decide what to say that I haven't said.

78
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:09,596
About the Outer Reach?

79
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,394
About anything. About whether any of this
is truly within our power to control.

80
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:20,315
However many words I have
left, I would hate to waste them.

81
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:22,526
You waste them when you
speak of the Outer Reach.

82
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:23,861
I speak of Seldon.

83
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:24,945
A man long dead.

84
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:27,656
And soon forgotten.

85
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:31,285
Does that mean his words have
no more worth in this Empire?

86
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:33,787
Brother, the Empire is strong...

87
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:40,169
Cleon I's legacy.

88
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:43,005
I wonder if there's a way to save it.

89
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:46,466
Stabilize it with propulsive lifts?
Push it out into the heavens?

90
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,218
To what end?

91
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:53,015
To the end that we not destroy
the last remnants of Cleon I's dream

92
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,017
for lack of our own.

93
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:03,650
Brother Dusk.

94
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:10,824
We are the great dream of
Cleon I, not the Star Bridge.

95
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:18,874
The dreamer.

96
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,463
The scholar.

97
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:27,758
The alchemist.

98
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,347
And me.

99
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,366
I've tried my whole life,

100
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:56,620
but I don't think I've ever
been able to make that face.

101
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:01,708
Come. Your brothers
have your last gift.

102
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:07,047
I would like to thank you,
Brothers, for this beautiful meal.

103
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:11,260
I can taste the care
you put into each bite.

104
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:17,474
Your time and your attention
is deeply appreciated.

105
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:19,893
You're very welcome, Brother.

106
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:22,729
But this is not the gift.

107
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:09,776
Welcome to Trantor,
the eye of the Empire.

108
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,737
It's been so long.

109
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:15,157
He was glorious, wasn't he?

110
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,909
Please respect and enjoy the peace.

111
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:18,118
Indeed.

112
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:22,623
And we will build something
greater in his honor. For you.

113
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:27,628
Please respect and enjoy the peace.

114
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:02,431
You can't be here. You know that.

115
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:07,019
I can't be the first one who
wanted to see my youngest self.

116
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:09,062
Which is why we made the rule.

117
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:12,733
I've never heard that
song before. Or have I?

118
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,491
No wonder the Empire loves you so.

119
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:28,332
I find I cannot quite look
on that child as an innocent.

120
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:29,833
Even if Seldon wasn't right...

121
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,129
there is something unnatural in that.

122
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:37,424
You must go.

123
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:40,135
You should rest.

124
00:12:50,646 --> 00:12:54,066
Strange, watching yourself being born.

125
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:08,557
Sleep. I'll see you tomorrow.

126
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,267
I saw you tonight...

127
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:14,438
watching our first brother
in the old Star Bridge.

128
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:17,191
Are we not enough?

129
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:21,236
Is that why you miss him?

130
00:14:23,614 --> 00:14:25,574
Oh, no, sweet brother.

131
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:28,368
You are enough.

132
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:44,885
It's just that you always leave me.

133
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:38,397
You have grown into our greatness,

134
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:43,026
Brother Dawn, now Day.

135
00:15:56,582 --> 00:15:59,960
Thank you, Brother Dusk.

136
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:15,851
And the new Dawn, just awoken.

137
00:16:16,602 --> 00:16:19,563
You have a long, beautiful day ahead.

138
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:28,614
Brother Darkness, it's time.

139
00:16:44,213 --> 00:16:45,964
The dream lives on in you.

140
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:49,134
Because you kept it alive in you.

141
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,573
Shh. It's okay.

142
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:18,204
You're all right.

143
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,874
Everything is all right.

144
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,003
No.

145
00:17:28,674 --> 00:17:30,425
Something's wrong.

146
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:50,237
Demerzel.

147
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:54,533
I don't forget anything or anyone.

148
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:58,579
Empire is always on my mind.

149
00:18:42,414 --> 00:18:44,041
Shh.

150
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:06,522
To be alive is to know ghosts.

151
00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:15,614
We hear their whispers if we listen.

152
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:22,454
We are haunted by prophets, all.

153
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:29,628
Are you certain you want
it erased, Brother Dawn?

154
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:30,712
Yes.

155
00:19:31,547 --> 00:19:32,548
I've outgrown it.

156
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:41,098
We ignore the dead at our peril.

157
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:48,856
And as Empire cycled
through a generation of Cleons,

158
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:51,567
the Foundation began
colonizing Terminus.

159
00:19:52,985 --> 00:19:56,321
The Empire underestimated
Hari. We all did.

160
00:19:58,031 --> 00:20:01,994
Hari had predicted the Cleons
would opt for exile over execution...

161
00:20:03,996 --> 00:20:06,748
that his followers' end
point would be Terminus.

162
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:23,765
Every aspect of their
arrival was predetermined...

163
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:29,605
when the colonists would land...

164
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:34,902
where they would build their outpost.

165
00:20:52,336 --> 00:20:54,671
So imagine their surprise

166
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:58,759
when they discovered that
something else was already there.

167
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,431
What in Seldon's name is that?

168
00:21:26,537 --> 00:21:28,121
It wasn't in the surveys.

169
00:21:28,205 --> 00:21:29,706
Should we go back?

170
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:32,918
Go back where, Mari? This
was always a one-way journey.

171
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:36,755
- I'll check it out.
- No. We go together.

172
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:46,765
Lowre, are you all right?

173
00:21:46,849 --> 00:21:47,933
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Come on.

174
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:50,394
- I'm just a little light-headed.
- Come on.

175
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:56,275
Get back.

176
00:21:58,902 --> 00:22:00,654
Abbas! Get back.

177
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:14,918
It became known as the Vault.

178
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:18,672
And over the decades,
countless myths grew up around it.

179
00:22:20,924 --> 00:22:23,760
It was an ancient
artifact left by aliens...

180
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:29,183
a surveillance outpost
sent ahead by the Cleons.

181
00:22:31,393 --> 00:22:33,520
All the settlers knew for certain

182
00:22:33,604 --> 00:22:37,191
was that the Vault wouldn't
allow anyone to approach it.

183
00:22:38,442 --> 00:22:40,819
And so they kept away.

184
00:22:56,251 --> 00:22:57,961
The slow ship was scuttled...

185
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:01,673
a refuge built from its bones.

186
00:23:06,553 --> 00:23:10,390
And what was once
mysterious became mundane.

187
00:23:16,438 --> 00:23:18,190
Her teachers say she's difficult.

188
00:23:19,483 --> 00:23:20,567
She's an outsider.

189
00:23:22,152 --> 00:23:23,278
Good.

190
00:23:23,362 --> 00:23:25,239
You're not listening to me, Abbas.

191
00:23:25,906 --> 00:23:26,907
She's a dreamer.

192
00:23:28,158 --> 00:23:30,202
She's distracted.

193
00:23:32,037 --> 00:23:33,914
She's a thinker, like you.

194
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:38,585
She's not distracted.

195
00:23:40,003 --> 00:23:41,088
She's aware.

196
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,008
Just look at her.
She's fascinated by it.

197
00:23:50,305 --> 00:23:51,306
It's pretty.

198
00:23:52,891 --> 00:23:54,142
It's dangerous.

199
00:23:54,226 --> 00:23:56,019
What do you think's inside it?

200
00:23:56,103 --> 00:23:57,980
We don't know.

201
00:23:58,063 --> 00:23:59,982
Then how do you know it's dangerous?

202
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:07,489
Come on.

203
00:25:16,058 --> 00:25:17,059
There you go.

204
00:25:18,936 --> 00:25:19,937
Get away.

205
00:26:04,439 --> 00:26:07,067
One of these days you'll
get me, and you'll be so sorry.

206
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,235
You're looking good.

207
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:09,736
Yeah, coordinated.

208
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:12,030
- Which parts?
- Right boot with left boot.

209
00:26:12,114 --> 00:26:13,657
How did I miss that?

210
00:26:14,491 --> 00:26:16,326
How goes the wild work?

211
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:18,370
Just got back from
patrolling the highlands.

212
00:26:18,453 --> 00:26:21,415
Lichen beds are shrinking. Ice
lunes are already heading south.

213
00:26:21,498 --> 00:26:23,375
Means we're gonna
have a nice warm spring.

214
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:24,710
Tell me you don't miss it.

215
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:27,421
What, the stench of sulfur?

216
00:26:28,714 --> 00:26:29,715
And the frostbite?

217
00:26:29,798 --> 00:26:33,218
Nah, being a warden suits you
a lot better than it ever did me.

218
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:37,514
Wow. That's a big one, hey?

219
00:26:37,598 --> 00:26:42,227
Yeah. Bishop's claw,
female. Maybe 600 kilos.

220
00:26:42,311 --> 00:26:45,230
She's been testing the fence
late at night the last few weeks.

221
00:26:45,314 --> 00:26:48,525
I'm gonna call her
Maybel. She's a loner.

222
00:26:50,402 --> 00:26:53,572
Salvor, why have you got me out
here at this time in the morning, huh?

223
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:58,702
I know when my daughter's
procrastinating. Come on.

224
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:01,788
I did a little test.

225
00:27:03,832 --> 00:27:06,585
Something's wrong with the null field.

226
00:27:07,169 --> 00:27:08,962
And what made you check it now?

227
00:27:09,046 --> 00:27:10,464
I don't know. A feeling?

228
00:27:11,924 --> 00:27:13,759
I checked it out. I got evidence.

229
00:27:13,842 --> 00:27:15,719
Of course. And have you told her yet?

230
00:27:15,802 --> 00:27:17,137
Wanted you to know first.

231
00:27:17,221 --> 00:27:20,307
I appreciate that. But
it is for her to know.

232
00:27:22,434 --> 00:27:23,894
And stress the evidence part.

233
00:27:55,092 --> 00:27:57,427
Thanks to the efforts of Dr. Seldon,

234
00:27:57,511 --> 00:28:00,180
Cleon XII established our refuge...

235
00:28:00,264 --> 00:28:03,809
In terms of timekeeping, the water
clock is the more precise instrument.

236
00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:08,438
Right. But it also requires
water to work, doesn't it?

237
00:28:08,522 --> 00:28:09,815
Well, obviously.

238
00:28:09,898 --> 00:28:12,150
What happens when the
water runs out, Novice Jord?

239
00:28:12,234 --> 00:28:16,113
For a sundial, all you need is the gnomon.
That's the blade sticking out of it.

240
00:28:16,196 --> 00:28:18,073
And, of course... the sun.

241
00:28:19,324 --> 00:28:25,455
Hari Seldon entrusted us with rebuilding
civilization after the collapse.

242
00:28:25,539 --> 00:28:26,748
We can't assume anything.

243
00:28:26,832 --> 00:28:29,251
Whether or not our future
survivors will be able to read,

244
00:28:29,334 --> 00:28:30,627
or what language they'll speak.

245
00:28:30,711 --> 00:28:33,589
We don't even know what
worlds they'll be scattered upon.

246
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:37,384
What if they find
themselves on Cygnus Prime,

247
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:41,221
where the only moisture to be
gained is from weeping vines?

248
00:28:41,305 --> 00:28:45,142
So, yes, this water
clock is more precise,

249
00:28:46,185 --> 00:28:47,853
but the sundial is more practical.

250
00:28:47,936 --> 00:28:51,690
We can't provide for every condition or
contingency our descendants will face.

251
00:28:51,773 --> 00:28:54,234
By the same token, we can't
preserve every innovation,

252
00:28:54,318 --> 00:28:56,528
so we have to choose and keep choosing.

253
00:28:58,363 --> 00:28:59,907
Until the fall comes.

254
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:02,326
I'd have picked the water clock.

255
00:29:02,409 --> 00:29:05,078
And you could have, if
you were still training here.

256
00:29:05,162 --> 00:29:06,663
Sorry, that was...

257
00:29:06,747 --> 00:29:08,290
I know you're suited to where you are,

258
00:29:08,373 --> 00:29:10,459
keeping us safe, making
sure the Foundation survives...

259
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:12,336
I'm making sure you
survive. The Foundation...

260
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:14,338
It's the same thing.
We are the Foundation.

261
00:29:14,421 --> 00:29:17,549
I am not. But you
believe. And that is fine.

262
00:29:17,633 --> 00:29:19,468
No. Do not make this sound like a cult.

263
00:29:19,551 --> 00:29:22,804
Some of us in our generation know
what real religious fervor looks like.

264
00:29:22,888 --> 00:29:25,265
Do you even wanna know
what I came to tell you?

265
00:29:30,479 --> 00:29:32,439
You know I don't like being near it.

266
00:29:32,523 --> 00:29:35,651
Dad said you'd want evidence, and
this you gotta experience for yourself.

267
00:29:38,695 --> 00:29:40,113
The null field is expanding.

268
00:29:41,448 --> 00:29:44,618
The field used to start
there. Now it starts here.

269
00:29:46,453 --> 00:29:49,498
If it keeps expanding, we
might need to clear out the town.

270
00:30:15,816 --> 00:30:17,776
I remember the first
time I found you out here.

271
00:30:18,735 --> 00:30:20,821
Four years old, middle of the night,

272
00:30:21,697 --> 00:30:25,117
standing right under
it like it was... nothing.

273
00:30:27,578 --> 00:30:29,663
And you wouldn't turn
when I called your name.

274
00:30:30,247 --> 00:30:32,291
Yeah, I thought it was calling to me.

275
00:30:32,374 --> 00:30:33,458
The ghost.

276
00:30:35,294 --> 00:30:36,628
Like an imaginary friend.

277
00:30:38,297 --> 00:30:41,466
I lay on the ground and tried to
crawl to you, but the pain was too great.

278
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:42,885
You just...

279
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:46,054
looked at me.

280
00:30:47,848 --> 00:30:51,852
I couldn't understand why the
Vault was hurting you but not me.

281
00:30:52,352 --> 00:30:53,604
You're special, Salvor.

282
00:30:54,897 --> 00:30:56,106
You always have been.

283
00:30:58,609 --> 00:30:59,985
Then why keep it a secret?

284
00:31:03,071 --> 00:31:05,407
Your father and I didn't want
people treating you differently.

285
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:09,077
Yeah, but they do,
Mom. They always have.

286
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,415
I make them uncomfortable.

287
00:31:14,124 --> 00:31:15,375
Just like the Vault.

288
00:31:15,459 --> 00:31:17,002
Is it calling to you now?

289
00:31:19,505 --> 00:31:20,547
Not in words.

290
00:31:21,882 --> 00:31:23,217
Make your case.

291
00:31:26,053 --> 00:31:27,304
I think it's waking up.

292
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,681
You and the other encyclopedists,

293
00:31:29,765 --> 00:31:33,769
you've been preparing
for some distant crisis.

294
00:31:36,563 --> 00:31:37,814
But I think it's here.

295
00:31:39,024 --> 00:31:40,025
Now.

296
00:31:43,529 --> 00:31:46,114
Gia! Keir! Guys, Hugo's here!

297
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,910
- Hugo's here!
- Hugo's here! Hugo's here, come on.

298
00:31:50,577 --> 00:31:52,746
- Hugo's here!
- Come on, Hugo!

299
00:31:52,829 --> 00:31:54,540
- Hugo!
- Hugo!

300
00:31:54,623 --> 00:31:56,583
Hugo!

301
00:31:56,667 --> 00:31:58,627
Whoa. Look at that! Come on.

302
00:32:06,093 --> 00:32:09,012
- Cut through this way!
- Whoa. Hey, now. Hey!

303
00:32:09,096 --> 00:32:10,973
- Oh, you can't get me.
- Through here.

304
00:32:11,056 --> 00:32:14,142
Come on, guys. Come
on. Hurry up! Let's go!

305
00:32:14,226 --> 00:32:16,270
Poly, come on! Hurry up!

306
00:32:16,895 --> 00:32:19,106
Hugo! Hugo!

307
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,820
- Hugo!
- Hugo!

308
00:32:24,903 --> 00:32:26,113
Four-sworn, Hugo!

309
00:32:26,196 --> 00:32:29,491
Gentlemen, ladies. What
can I do for you grown adults?

310
00:32:29,575 --> 00:32:30,951
Got anything for us?

311
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:34,413
Korellian chocolate.
Knock yourselves out.

312
00:32:34,913 --> 00:32:37,624
We don't want chocolate.
How about some beer?

313
00:32:37,708 --> 00:32:40,752
How about you come back and see
me when you got hair on your chest?

314
00:32:40,836 --> 00:32:42,629
And don't come begging
for it like wayward puppies.

315
00:32:42,713 --> 00:32:44,965
We're not begging. We're... trading.

316
00:32:45,048 --> 00:32:46,967
Is that so? What for what?

317
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:49,845
How about our sparkling
wit and company?

318
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:51,471
Hard pass.

319
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,017
Tell you what.

320
00:32:56,185 --> 00:32:58,187
If you clowns could help me load out,

321
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:01,148
I might be able to scrounge up something
a little more age-appropriate for you.

322
00:33:01,231 --> 00:33:02,941
Deal. I'll do it.

323
00:33:03,025 --> 00:33:04,109
We all will.

324
00:33:04,193 --> 00:33:05,194
Go on then.

325
00:33:05,277 --> 00:33:06,695
- Come on, guys.
- Come on.

326
00:33:06,778 --> 00:33:08,780
- Keir, catch. Poly.
- I'm here.

327
00:33:22,461 --> 00:33:23,545
That smells terrible.

328
00:33:24,129 --> 00:33:26,798
It should. It's sealant
for my gum boots.

329
00:33:26,882 --> 00:33:28,008
More onions than I expected.

330
00:33:29,134 --> 00:33:30,844
I may have used the wrong recipe.

331
00:33:30,928 --> 00:33:32,596
That would be a tragic mishap.

332
00:33:34,681 --> 00:33:35,766
It'll keep.

333
00:33:37,726 --> 00:33:38,769
What's wrong?

334
00:33:39,603 --> 00:33:40,896
There's a man in my kitchen.

335
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:46,318
How long are you here?

336
00:33:47,152 --> 00:33:49,404
Twenty-nine long hours.

337
00:33:51,198 --> 00:33:53,075
And how's the rest of the galaxy?

338
00:33:53,158 --> 00:33:54,159
Oh, it's big.

339
00:33:54,868 --> 00:33:56,286
You should see it sometime.

340
00:33:57,412 --> 00:33:58,413
Should I?

341
00:34:09,049 --> 00:34:10,300
Irina Four.

342
00:34:11,385 --> 00:34:13,512
Only one continent,
but it's tropical all over.

343
00:34:13,594 --> 00:34:15,848
It's got bugs the size of
dogs and just as cuddly.

344
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:19,184
Dropped off medicine,
I picked up fruit.

345
00:34:19,268 --> 00:34:21,687
Such is the itinerant life
of the wayward purveyor.

346
00:34:22,228 --> 00:34:24,690
- Where'd you take the fruit?
- To Hesperus.

347
00:34:24,773 --> 00:34:27,234
Which you could describe
as well as me by now.

348
00:34:27,317 --> 00:34:31,112
But I was off on a whirlwind
tour of this little cluster.

349
00:34:32,447 --> 00:34:34,533
Once they started
trading, they couldn't stop.

350
00:34:34,616 --> 00:34:38,495
Little rectangular situation of
workers and sugar, rum, cash.

351
00:34:40,121 --> 00:34:43,292
You think you've got a handful of
moons, you should see what they got.

352
00:34:43,375 --> 00:34:45,460
The sky looks like spilled coins.

353
00:34:45,543 --> 00:34:47,295
- Spilled coins?
- Mm-hmm.

354
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:48,839
I'd love to see that.

355
00:34:48,922 --> 00:34:51,842
Well, you need to go.
Get off this ball of ice.

356
00:34:53,177 --> 00:34:56,221
- I've got responsibilities here.
- Oh, but you didn't pick them.

357
00:34:56,304 --> 00:34:58,098
Nah, they're still mine. And...

358
00:34:59,933 --> 00:35:02,436
Is it possible to know you've got
reasons and not know what they are?

359
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:04,396
Reasons you're important to this place?

360
00:35:05,397 --> 00:35:07,649
It's possible. A little
egotistical, but possible.

361
00:35:07,733 --> 00:35:10,068
I didn't say I was
important. I said I can't leave.

362
00:35:13,113 --> 00:35:15,616
Speaking of leaving, would
you like dinner now or after?

363
00:35:17,242 --> 00:35:18,243
After sounds good.

364
00:36:16,385 --> 00:36:17,636
What are you doing?

365
00:36:19,596 --> 00:36:20,597
Is something wrong?

366
00:36:21,974 --> 00:36:24,893
Just a weird feeling. I'm
gonna walk the perimeter.

367
00:36:24,977 --> 00:36:27,688
What, because that's where
the weird feeling is coming from?

368
00:36:27,771 --> 00:36:29,189
No, that is in here.

369
00:36:30,399 --> 00:36:31,692
This is just a walk.

370
00:36:31,775 --> 00:36:35,279
So if I said, "Let me get
my pants," you'd say?

371
00:36:35,362 --> 00:36:39,157
No pants for the next 25 hours.

372
00:36:42,578 --> 00:36:44,746
- Will you be mad later?
- Never.

373
00:37:05,392 --> 00:37:06,810
What are you doing out there?

374
00:37:09,813 --> 00:37:10,981
Stop!

375
00:37:18,071 --> 00:37:20,574
Stop. It's after curfew.

376
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,969
Hello? Hello?

377
00:38:13,335 --> 00:38:14,336
Who are you?

378
00:39:06,513 --> 00:39:07,681
What the hell?

379
00:39:08,432 --> 00:39:09,933
I heard a shot. What's up?

380
00:39:10,017 --> 00:39:12,561
Am I crazy, or is that ship Anacreon?

381
00:39:17,816 --> 00:39:19,484
Oh, you're crazy.

382
00:39:19,568 --> 00:39:20,777
But not about that.

383
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:31,580
And then there are three.

384
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,416
- Hail them.
- We already have. No answer.

385
00:39:34,499 --> 00:39:36,543
And they're ignoring
our approach vectors.

386
00:39:36,627 --> 00:39:38,504
Should we send one of
our shuttles to meet them?

387
00:39:38,587 --> 00:39:39,880
Your unarmed shuttles?

388
00:39:40,964 --> 00:39:43,342
Those are corvettes. Gunships.

389
00:39:43,425 --> 00:39:44,718
Why is he here?

390
00:39:44,801 --> 00:39:46,803
Because he knows
what gunships look like.

391
00:39:46,887 --> 00:39:48,222
Also, he's Thespin.

392
00:39:48,305 --> 00:39:49,681
Been off-world since the bombings.

393
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:51,850
Impossible. That would make you...

394
00:39:51,934 --> 00:39:55,270
Pushing 70. But I spent half
that cryosleeping between ports.

395
00:39:55,812 --> 00:39:58,065
When you tow freight to
Anacreon, it pays to be blood-neutral.

396
00:39:58,148 --> 00:40:01,652
- Anacreon is under imperial sanction.
- Grow up, Lewis.

397
00:40:01,735 --> 00:40:04,696
Maybe it's a mistake. Maybe
they wandered off course.

398
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,698
They're literally trying to
sneak in under our radar.

399
00:40:06,782 --> 00:40:09,868
We are a scientific outpost.
We have nothing of value here.

400
00:40:09,952 --> 00:40:12,496
Mayor, have the Anacreons
ever made landfall here before?

401
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:15,415
No Anacreons, no
Thespins. No one in 30 years.

402
00:40:15,499 --> 00:40:18,293
Under imperial edict, Terminus
is off-limit to all of them.

403
00:40:18,377 --> 00:40:19,962
It's gotta be connected to the Vault.

404
00:40:20,045 --> 00:40:21,338
What?

405
00:40:22,256 --> 00:40:24,049
The null field's expanding.

406
00:40:24,132 --> 00:40:25,467
- I noticed it yesterday.
- How fast?

407
00:40:25,551 --> 00:40:27,302
The next day, the Anacreons showed up.

408
00:40:27,386 --> 00:40:29,930
Technically, we are
an imperial outpost.

409
00:40:30,013 --> 00:40:33,392
And Lord knows the Anacreons
have a bone to pick with the Empire.

410
00:40:33,475 --> 00:40:35,602
Are you suggesting the
Vault might be an Anacreon...

411
00:40:35,686 --> 00:40:38,021
I'm suggesting the Vault
knew something and reacted.

412
00:40:38,105 --> 00:40:39,356
Maybe it even warned us.

413
00:40:39,439 --> 00:40:44,653
Are you saying the Vault was signaling
you because you're somehow, what, special?

414
00:40:45,237 --> 00:40:47,364
Salvor is an outlier.

415
00:40:47,447 --> 00:40:50,075
We need to think whether the
Plan could have possibly predicted...

416
00:40:50,158 --> 00:40:51,451
Forget the Plan.

417
00:40:51,535 --> 00:40:52,703
Seldon's gone.

418
00:40:53,745 --> 00:40:55,706
When are any of you gonna
start thinking for yourselves?

419
00:40:55,789 --> 00:40:59,001
All right, that's enough. We don't
need to make this complicated.

420
00:40:59,084 --> 00:41:03,422
The Anacreons have ignored our hails, and
they are violating imperial aerospace.

421
00:41:03,505 --> 00:41:05,424
Our course of action is obvious.

422
00:41:05,507 --> 00:41:07,301
We'll uplink to the communications buoy

423
00:41:07,384 --> 00:41:09,595
as soon as we hit the
next rotational window.

424
00:41:10,179 --> 00:41:12,973
We'll call the Empire,
and they will come.

425
00:41:14,308 --> 00:41:15,767
Where are you going?

426
00:41:15,851 --> 00:41:17,186
To check out the armory.

427
00:41:18,854 --> 00:41:21,231
If the Anacreons come
knocking before the Empire,

428
00:41:21,315 --> 00:41:23,901
I'd like to know what kind
of violence we can muster.

429
00:41:25,027 --> 00:41:26,778
When was the last time
these were broken down?

430
00:41:26,862 --> 00:41:29,531
- So we're a little complacent.
- I've got an ion pistol, if that helps.

431
00:41:29,615 --> 00:41:31,533
Mom, anything we could
use in the curation stores?

432
00:41:31,617 --> 00:41:34,203
A few hand axes, a shepherd's
sling from Weaver's World.

433
00:41:34,286 --> 00:41:36,455
- I should've been on top of this.
- Not your job.

434
00:41:36,538 --> 00:41:39,166
- No? I keep you safe, remember?
- Come on. Come on.

435
00:41:39,249 --> 00:41:41,710
Generally I propose
alcohol at a juncture like this.

436
00:41:42,711 --> 00:41:44,254
Rotational window's open.

437
00:41:45,172 --> 00:41:47,841
Handshake protocol. It
just takes a few seconds.

438
00:42:00,646 --> 00:42:01,813
What's wrong?

439
00:42:01,897 --> 00:42:05,108
Comms buoy's not responding
to any of our pings. It's gone dark.

440
00:42:05,901 --> 00:42:07,110
Use another one then.

441
00:42:07,194 --> 00:42:08,487
There isn't another one.

442
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:09,780
So, what does that mean?

443
00:42:10,364 --> 00:42:11,865
We can't contact the Empire.

444
00:42:14,117 --> 00:42:16,537
Well, keep trying. Don't panic.

445
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:19,873
Could be something as simple
as a meteor shower. It'll clear.

446
00:42:20,749 --> 00:42:22,501
On the heels of an Anacreon flyby?

447
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:26,004
Assuming the Anacreons
intend landfall here,

448
00:42:26,088 --> 00:42:27,506
how long before they arrive?

449
00:42:27,589 --> 00:42:31,051
Based on their current
approach, I'd say another 40 hours.

450
00:42:38,475 --> 00:42:39,476
Mom.

451
00:43:15,429 --> 00:43:16,430
Whoa.

452
00:43:18,557 --> 00:43:19,558
What is that?

453
00:43:21,518 --> 00:43:22,811
Psychohistory.

454
00:43:23,937 --> 00:43:26,773
All of Hari's work expressed
as a mathematical equation.

455
00:43:27,441 --> 00:43:29,860
I took it from his office
the night after his funeral.

456
00:43:30,986 --> 00:43:33,697
His numbers are the basis
for why we do what we do.

457
00:43:34,781 --> 00:43:37,910
On the ship, there were two people
who could actually understand it.

458
00:43:37,993 --> 00:43:39,453
Hari Seldon and Gaal Dornick.

459
00:43:46,251 --> 00:43:47,628
Can you make anything of it?

460
00:43:47,711 --> 00:43:49,463
Me? No, not likely.

461
00:43:50,047 --> 00:43:53,759
Salvor, if you were part of the Plan,

462
00:43:54,343 --> 00:43:57,262
it would make it a lot easier
for me to believe in all this.

463
00:44:31,547 --> 00:44:33,298
Yeah, well, big surprise.

464
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:35,592
It was worth a shot.

465
00:44:35,676 --> 00:44:36,927
Was it?

466
00:44:37,594 --> 00:44:39,638
I told you, different's
not the same as special.

467
00:44:59,157 --> 00:45:00,576
Comms buoy is down.

468
00:45:02,327 --> 00:45:03,954
That is an ominous happenstance.

469
00:45:04,663 --> 00:45:06,248
You should probably hightail it.

470
00:45:08,458 --> 00:45:09,459
Oh, yeah?

471
00:45:11,211 --> 00:45:14,923
The Anacreons will be
here in two days. Maybe less.

472
00:45:15,424 --> 00:45:17,467
You would be safer anywhere but here.

473
00:45:18,552 --> 00:45:20,637
The scenery is so
beautiful this time of year.

474
00:45:21,346 --> 00:45:23,682
Vast wastelands of frozen lune shit.

475
00:45:23,765 --> 00:45:24,975
I'm serious, Hugo.

476
00:45:25,058 --> 00:45:26,059
You tend to be.

477
00:45:28,478 --> 00:45:29,646
I'm not going anywhere.

478
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:31,064
This isn't your fight.

479
00:45:31,148 --> 00:45:33,483
Oh, yeah? Whose fight is it then?

480
00:45:39,323 --> 00:45:40,324
Seldon's?

481
00:45:42,367 --> 00:45:43,952
Then it's not your fight either.

482
00:45:46,747 --> 00:45:47,748
Come away with me.

483
00:45:49,166 --> 00:45:50,167
I can't.

484
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:51,251
Why not?

485
00:45:54,213 --> 00:45:55,672
Because I have to protect them.

486
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:00,761
To be alive is to know ghosts.

487
00:46:01,845 --> 00:46:05,349
The Empire feared Hari because
he could forecast the future.

488
00:46:06,767 --> 00:46:10,604
But, in reality, all he was
doing was reexamining the past.

489
00:46:14,483 --> 00:46:15,901
What do you want?

490
00:46:17,653 --> 00:46:21,865
Pay attention to the patterns and
we can presage what comes next.

491
00:46:26,328 --> 00:46:28,789
To be alive is to know ghosts.

492
00:46:29,498 --> 00:46:32,000
We hear their whispers if we listen.

493
00:46:52,771 --> 00:46:53,897
You again.

494
00:47:26,805 --> 00:47:27,848
Hey there.

495
00:47:32,019 --> 00:47:33,270
What got you, Maybel?

496
00:47:41,403 --> 00:47:42,446
This is gonna hurt.

497
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:57,211
Easy.

498
00:47:59,004 --> 00:48:00,214
Drop your weapon.

499
00:48:06,887 --> 00:48:07,930
Who are you?

500
00:48:08,013 --> 00:48:11,725
Salvor Hardin, warden of Terminus.

501
00:48:16,772 --> 00:48:19,274
Anacreons aren't
allowed on imperial soil.

502
00:48:23,195 --> 00:48:24,321
What are you doing here?

503
00:48:25,239 --> 00:48:29,868
The ghosts of the dead haunt the
skeletons that were once our homes.

504
00:48:30,702 --> 00:48:32,287
They surround us.

505
00:48:32,371 --> 00:48:35,040
And they're hungry for what's ours.
