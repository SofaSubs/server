1
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:25,607
Three of them.

2
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:28,992
In special uniforms,
all done up and regal.

3
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,780
They put you in a line
and they go one at a time.

4
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,525
How many questions is it?

5
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:35,366
It's not that kind of test.

6
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:38,502
And they've got this device.
It's all special made, like.

7
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,830
They prick your arm.

8
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:41,374
Does it hurt?

9
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:42,498
Only for a bit.

10
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:44,094
Then you find out if you're Grisha,

11
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:45,879
and you go and live in the Little Palace

12
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:49,722
and eat sweet melon and Kerch candies,
wear special coats.

13
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,549
Has anyone from here been picked?

14
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:54,604
Once. First year in. Lucian.

15
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:57,179
The little pyro was
an Inferni, of course.

16
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:58,845
I want to be a Tidemaker.

17
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:00,643
I bet I'm a Squaller.

18
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:03,727
You break wind, you don't make it.

19
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:06,862
How does the test work?

20
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:08,532
For you?

21
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:10,901
For you, it won't.

22
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:13,817
They don't do the test
if you're sick or injured.

23
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:17,737
Thanks to your little scrap with dinner,
you're gonna have to skip this year, mutt.

24
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:19,947
Children, visitors.

25
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,805
She didn't see us. We're safe.

26
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,940
Don't you want to know if you're Grisha?

27
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:48,784
Not if we can't go together.

28
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:56,239
Mal! Alina!

29
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:41,488
Healer!

30
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:45,869
How many more?

31
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:47,877
Ten, maybe twelve of us, I think.

32
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:57,339
Hold! Your collarbone is fractured.

33
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,929
Mal! The tracker! Where is he?

34
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,555
First Army goes to medical.

35
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,975
- Bring her to the general's tent.
- Who?

36
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:13,987
But I'm not done yet.

37
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:15,608
You can go with her.

38
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,775
What was that? Hmm? You want to tell me?

39
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:21,947
Be more specific.

40
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,535
It was one thing when we had a week

41
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,460
to find a way across the Fold.
But sunrise?

42
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,248
- We have to say no.
- No.

43
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,082
- "No" to the job?
- "No" to saying "no."

44
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,747
- We can't go!
- Can't we?

45
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:33,376
I can't go.

46
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:37,179
You will. I have a plan.

47
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:38,378
- No, you don't.
- Inej!

48
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,928
I know by now
when you're still figuring things out.

49
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,812
You don't know how to pull off this job.

50
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,639
I still have six hours,
and right now, you aren't helping.

51
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:49,015
Maybe you crack a way across,
but that doesn't solve this problem!

52
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:51,273
- If I can't crack this, no one's going.
- If you do?

53
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,436
Then maybe you stay here.

54
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,607
Maybe I won't be here when you get back.

55
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:03,275
Inej! Inej!

56
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,614
Bring her closer.

57
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:00,629
Closer.

58
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:09,806
Well?

59
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:13,435
Well, what? Sir.

60
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:16,768
What are you?

61
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,653
Alina Starkov, Assistant Cartographer,
Royal Corps of Surveyors.

62
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:23,488
They're all gone.

63
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:27,372
It's my fault.
That's why I'm here, isn't it?

64
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:28,662
Answer the question.

65
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,120
What are you?

66
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,208
A mapmaker, sir.

67
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,126
Quiet.

68
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,102
So who actually saw what happened?

69
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,850
Zoya? You manned the main sail.

70
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:56,895
We were attacked barely two markers in.

71
00:05:58,274 --> 00:05:59,654
Someone lit a lantern.

72
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,359
And?

73
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:06,244
The volcra went after
the riflemen and our Inferni first.

74
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,118
And then there was a searing light.

75
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:10,834
It was her.

76
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:14,831
Our mapmaker.

77
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:21,340
Is this true? Can you summon light?

78
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,510
Where did you grow up?

79
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,306
- Keramzin.
- Hmm.

80
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,515
And when were you tested?

81
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,977
You don't remember?

82
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:45,571
Well, let us just make certain.

83
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,538
Alina Starkov, where is she?

84
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:01,377
They took her to General Kirigan's tent.

85
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:02,302
What? Why?

86
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,626
They think she's the Sun Summoner.

87
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,390
Corporal, you're wounded.

88
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,510
She's in trouble.

89
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,716
- How so?
- Because she isn't Grisha.

90
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:15,437
When they realize their mistake,
think what they'll do to her.

91
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:16,438
How are you so sure?

92
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,519
Because I know her
better than anyone else.

93
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:19,984
Lift up your sleeve.

94
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:23,994
What's happening?

95
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:29,276
Your sleeve. Please.

96
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:45,174
- Alina!
- Stop, soldier!

97
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:27,877
Alina.

98
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:45,863
Inej! Listen, I...

99
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:14,847
Evening.

100
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,517
Mr. Brekker, is it?

101
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:21,978
- You're a long way from home.
- Am I?

102
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,436
Like you were earlier?

103
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,107
When you took a Grisha from the Orchid.

104
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:30,322
The Orchid isn't Dime Lions turf.

105
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,823
Well, it's a new acquisition.

106
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,025
Hmm. You heard it here first.

107
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:36,373
Now.

108
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:45,131
Now, I know you saw Dreesen.

109
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:48,456
You got the jump on whatever job he has.

110
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:52,258
I don't know the details, obviously,

111
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:55,091
just that you have
a little travel hazard ahead of you.

112
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,557
So, here's the deal.

113
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,479
You can do nothing, walk away from it.

114
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,940
I'll tell Dreesen I'm
taking over for you.

115
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:08,065
- Then we're even.
- Not even close.

116
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,109
Hang on.

117
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,488
The other option is...

118
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:20,409
I'll cave your head in with your own
cane and dump you in the harbor.

119
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:23,246
Hmm?

120
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,839
That first option
seems better now, don't it?

121
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:34,934
Tell me...

122
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,641
have we ever made a deal before?

123
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,638
You and me? Nah.

124
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,767
Otherwise you'd know better.

125
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:46,688
Or you'd be dead.

126
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:55,243
Come on.

127
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:05,119
He doesn't have a way
across the Fold, and we both know it.

128
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,746
I bet he'll figure it out.

129
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,212
Come on, take that bet.

130
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:11,133
Bolliger won't play with me anymore, so...

131
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:13,838
Thank you.

132
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,257
He's obsessed
with taking down Pekka Rollins.

133
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,684
Of course he's obsessed
with the one villain in town

134
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:23,063
who's paid off the stadwatch
to get away with murder.

135
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,180
Thanks. Another one, Joe.

136
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:25,676
No, it's more than that.

137
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:29,355
I've seen the way Kaz looks
when he says Pekka's name.

138
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:30,858
Kaz wants revenge.

139
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,618
Of course she calls for me now.

140
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,907
Off to the Menagerie? Want company?

141
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:44,834
No.

142
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,673
No, I meant to watch your back.

143
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,884
You all right, boss?

144
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,967
No.

145
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:02,718
I've been warned off the job.

146
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:04,427
By who?

147
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:06,729
Who do you think?

148
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,056
Did he remember you?

149
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,106
If he had, I'd be dead.

150
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:15,225
Sunrise is in five hours.

151
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,947
Yeah, but we're off the job now, right?

152
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,526
Never make decisions
out of fear, Jesper.

153
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,368
Only out of spite.

154
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,752
Well, greed always worked for me.

155
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,747
Go guard the door.

156
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,450
I don't understand. I wasn't cheating.

157
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,171
You've been here every night for a week.

158
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:18,919
You don't play Makker's Wheel
or Ratcatcher, only cards.

159
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,836
Because you keep track of what's played.

160
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,505
Well, that is not cheating.

161
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,973
No, but I'll have to
add an extra deck to your table

162
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,224
to keep things more balanced.

163
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,983
An incentive to keep playing.

164
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,193
Count it for me.

165
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,084
Where are you from?

166
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:53,826
West Ravka. Os Kervo.

167
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,336
West Ravkans count money
from one hand to the other,

168
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:58,548
but people out east
who work the mines in Sikursk,

169
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,009
they count like you do.

170
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:03,968
I am from West Ravka.

171
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:05,891
West Ravkans don't
mention the "west" part.

172
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,890
To them, there's just Ravka
and the old country.

173
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:11,182
You're lying about where you're from
because you've fled.

174
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,267
You're hiding.

175
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,443
My daughter is Grisha.

176
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:23,359
Neither of us
wanted her to fight in the war.

177
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:24,605
You can't make us go back.

178
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,867
No, I'm not after you,

179
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:28,028
but you need to tell me
how you and your daughter

180
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,367
got through the Fold
unscathed and unnoticed.

181
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:31,292
Now.

182
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,544
He just went by a title.

183
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,092
The Conductor.

184
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:43,835
We paid him in advance

185
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:47,394
and he took us across
in some special transport.

186
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,930
It was noisy, but he had us wear hoods,

187
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,806
so we couldn't share how he does it.

188
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:56,938
I don't know what else to tell you.

189
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,271
Give me something. A name. An address.

190
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:01,066
A contact, someone he worked with.

191
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:08,616
He left us with a stage performer
who took us in for a few nights.

192
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,583
Poppy.

193
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:17,793
- Where's Poppy working these days?
- Emerald Palace, boss.

194
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:24,756
Go.

195
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:30,431
You heard me. Let's go. Get in.

196
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,136
No.

197
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,854
There's been a mistake.
I need to find Mal.

198
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,270
The general does not make mistakes.

199
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:42,108
His orders were to get you
to Little Palace immediately.

200
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,781
Now get in the coach.

201
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:44,939
Everyone makes mistakes.

202
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:47,279
Look at me. Do I look important to you?

203
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,873
You look like trouble.
Which is nearly the same.

204
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,079
- Move.
- Wait.

205
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:53,288
Malyen Oretsev. He's in the medic tent.

206
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,749
I need to speak to him.
I'm going to speak to him.

207
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:56,659
Listen to me.

208
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,617
Every spy in the area
will hear what you did

209
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:00,327
and our enemies will come for you.

210
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:03,127
Our only chance is to get you
to Os Alta, behind palace walls,

211
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,462
before you get killed. Come on.

212
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,772
- Mal!
- Alina!

213
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:16,975
No!

214
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,769
No, stop. I didn't know!

215
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,652
- Alina!
- I didn't know!

216
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:21,559
Alina!

217
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,071
Mal!

218
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:29,574
Are you two close?

219
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:32,452
Oh.

220
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,870
Is she the friend you ran off to?

221
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,582
Where are they taking her?

222
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:40,212
She'll be fine. She's in good hands.

223
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,958
Not while she's around Grisha.

224
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:47,463
Soldier! She is one now.

225
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,020
If you're back for work, get changed.

226
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,365
There you are.

227
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:22,579
Go on.

228
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,030
That one's new.

229
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,994
Would you like to see how it works?

230
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,950
Come, come. Sit.

231
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:04,374
Let us talk business.
I have some work for you.

232
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,844
I work for Kaz Brekker now.

233
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,749
That's not entirely true.

234
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:11,007
Mr. Brekker still owes
five more installments on you.

235
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,970
Regardless. I'm on a job.

236
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,970
So I hear. A little bird.

237
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:19,103
Some business across the water.
Far east, yes?

238
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,227
You should ask him.

239
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:25,813
Sit. I insist.

240
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:31,939
I've a more important question for you.

241
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,737
Do you want to go with him?

242
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:38,532
Because you know you can't leave town
without my permission, so...

243
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,497
If you want to leave,
you must be paid in full.

244
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:44,368
That's too much. Kaz doesn't have that.

245
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:48,538
I'm not concerned with what he has,
but I like what you have.

246
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:51,417
A set of skills I
happen to need tonight.

247
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:54,795
This business with the blades,
and the shadows.

248
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:57,723
You must be quite good
for Brekker to pay for you.

249
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:01,518
So, find this man

250
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:04,428
staying tonight at this address...

251
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:06,767
and kill him for me.

252
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,477
Kill him?

253
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:12,943
Do this and you are free and clear.

254
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:16,449
Our business will be done.
But it must be tonight.

255
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:27,882
- Who is he?
- Does it matter?

256
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,342
He's in the same business
that brought you to my door.

257
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,011
Sells to the White Rose,
but won't sell to me.

258
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:38,930
The boys and girls he's bringing in are
driving my clients to the competition.

259
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:39,971
So...

260
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,269
drive a knife into his heart.

261
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,635
Do we have an agreement?

262
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,008
- Jesper.
- Whoa!

263
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:16,918
How do you do that?

264
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,467
I need your help.

265
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,390
Of course, love. Doing what?

266
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,229
I need you to kill a man for me.

267
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:30,979
Oh. Why me?

268
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:35,653
But you've got as many knives
as I've got teeth.

269
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:38,364
- You know why.
- Yeah.

270
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:41,365
But how is getting me to do it
any different from you doing it?

271
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,034
Will you help me or not?

272
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:48,409
- Like I said, of course. But...
- Jesper! New job.

273
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:52,712
Come along.

274
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,710
She did it again.

275
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:10,806
- This is Fedyor.
- Pleasure to meet you.

276
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:14,732
They call this a kefta.
It's bulletproof.

277
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,439
The uniform of the Second Army.

278
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:21,781
What about the First Army?
Back in Kribirsk.

279
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:24,573
A thousand soldiers marching with us.
Isn't that safer?

280
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,698
Slower, not safer. Not really.

281
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:31,745
If you left me with the cartography
unit, no one would look twice at us.

282
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,710
Why is that?

283
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:40,218
You summon pure sunlight.

284
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,299
Your kind of Etherealki
has just been a theory,

285
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,054
a picture in a storybook.

286
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,096
Until now.

287
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:48,971
You're a very special girl,

288
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:51,557
so how has no one
looked twice at you before?

289
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:52,693
Are you joking?

290
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:55,233
Maybe it's nicer
inside the Little Palace,

291
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,904
but out here, when you're different,

292
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,903
when you look different,

293
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,815
everything's at risk
of becoming a fight.

294
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:05,413
Do you know why the Little Palace
has walls in the first place? Hmm?

295
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,911
Because for years,
being Grisha was a death sentence.

296
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:13,537
At least now, thanks to General Kirigan,
we're protected. Feared.

297
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:15,287
And that's how we survive.

298
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,050
Not by being overlooked,

299
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:21,298
but by making them look,
and knowing you're powerful.

300
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:24,051
I've survived long enough
without your protection. Thank you.

301
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:27,184
But you wouldn't last a minute
now that you are you.

302
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,853
All of Ravka has been waiting for you.

303
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:31,772
I get it.

304
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,850
The whole country
wants to see the Fold gone.

305
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:35,435
But it's bigger than that.

306
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,780
You are hope for the country, yes,
but a myth come true for a Grisha.

307
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:42,278
It was a Grisha who created the Fold.

308
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,910
If a Grisha destroys it, maybe...

309
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,616
Maybe we wouldn't need those high walls
to protect us anymore.

310
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:02,013
The road is blocked! Beware!

311
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,881
Stay here, and don't leave.

312
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:06,887
Hold it here!

313
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:10,718
He means well.

314
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:16,521
Watch the tree line
for movement.

315
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,146
Drüskelle...

316
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,634
Sharpshooter!

317
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,211
Sharpshooter!

318
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:29,218
What's going on?

319
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,558
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

320
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:39,693
Didn't penetrate.

321
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,020
Listen to the heartbeats.
How many are there?

322
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,363
- There's too much smoke!
- Squaller!

323
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:52,117
- I can't see!
- Where's the Squaller?

324
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,329
Get to the carriage!
Protect the girl!

325
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:02,082
Squaller!

326
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,173
Witch!

327
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:11,974
Please!

328
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:17,308
No! Please! Please!

329
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:20,020
I'm not Grisha! I'm a mapmaker!

330
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,572
What you are is a witch.

331
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:53,719
Darkling.

332
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:11,283
Are you hurt?

333
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:15,278
No, not really.

334
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:17,525
The others will have fled
now they know I'm here.

335
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:23,038
You ride with me.

336
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,264
I mean it. We need a demo man.

337
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:35,342
You're still on that?

338
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,797
I just brought it up tonight.

339
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:39,386
Jesper, you ask for an explosives expert
on every job.

340
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:41,562
Because I don't want to be the one
you point to

341
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:43,141
and say, "Explode something for us."

342
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:46,266
That is not a Jesper talent.
I shoot things with style.

343
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:50,234
And I look good.
Just play to my strengths, boss.

344
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:52,687
Alina Starkov will be kept
at the Little Palace.

345
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:55,317
Entering the Little Palace
requires us to be quiet.

346
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:57,065
Blowing something
up, we've likely failed.

347
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:59,077
Then we should take Inej.

348
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,449
She's a good investment.
More quiet than I'll ever be.

349
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:03,036
She can't stay here, you know that.

350
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,921
Whoa. Hang on,
aren't we on Pekka's turf now?

351
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,594
I go to Heleen now
and ask for her buyout,

352
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:11,088
she knows I need Inej
and sets a price I can't pay.

353
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:14,219
That's evil. Well, how do you know that?

354
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:15,926
It's what I would do.

355
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:19,798
Besides, Inej refuses to kill.

356
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:23,102
Would you trust her
in a matter of life and death?

357
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:26,693
Well, I've trusted her so far
and I'm still alive, so, yeah.

358
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:30,107
Now, you want to tell me
why we're scoping out a rival club?

359
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:32,687
To have a talk
with an old business partner.

360
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,566
The bouncers will know you on sight.

361
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:36,152
That's why I brought you.

362
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:37,657
Make sure they don't see me.

363
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:43,374
Handsome decoy is also
not a Jesper talent.

364
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:57,835
Seventeen, twelve...

365
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,973
uh, thirteen point five.

366
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:07,274
Nope, sorry, Anatov, no room for you.

367
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:18,493
Can we stop? Please.

368
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:19,451
Why?

369
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:21,985
My tailbone is killing me.

370
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:34,997
For your face.

371
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:55,439
What happened back there?

372
00:28:57,944 --> 00:28:58,954
Drüskelle.

373
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,318
Elite members of the Fjerdan military

374
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,196
trained to infiltrate
deep behind our lines

375
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:05,163
and kill or kidnap Grisha.

376
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:08,873
I meant how you sliced one of
them in half from a dozen paces.

377
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,250
Would you rather I'd used a sword?

378
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,422
I don't know.

379
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:21,216
Sorry.

380
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:24,104
It's fine.

381
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:32,023
There is matter to everything.

382
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,273
Even air.

383
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,440
Or shadow.

384
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:37,901
Too small to see.

385
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:42,565
The Cut is something a Summoner can do,

386
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:44,485
but it requires tremendous skill.

387
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,160
And I would only
use it as a last resort.

388
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:49,408
Like that ambush.

389
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:50,326
Saints...

390
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:54,708
Is this my life now?
Hunted wherever I go.

391
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:57,337
You get used to it.

392
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,591
How did they even know about me?

393
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:04,844
Your little light show in the Fold
was visible from miles away.

394
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:09,095
Whatever their original mission was,
they must have diverted to find you.

395
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:10,812
That's why I'm traveling with you.

396
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:14,055
They're that scared of you?

397
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:17,021
I think they're more scared of you.

398
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,401
Why?

399
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,026
What your power means to us.

400
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:25,823
You may well be the first of your kind,

401
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:28,414
but we've always had a name for you.

402
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,910
For what we hope you can do.

403
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:35,790
Enter the Fold. Destroy it from within.

404
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:39,169
With proper training,
some amplification, you could be the...

405
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:40,264
No!

406
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:45,506
No?

407
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,220
No, what?

408
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:50,064
I don't want any of this.

409
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:51,849
Why can't you get rid of it?

410
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,603
Do you think I haven't tried,
Miss Starkov?

411
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,900
If I enter the Fold,
I'm a beacon for the volcra.

412
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:00,567
All I can do is make it worse.

413
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,990
Then just...
Can't you use some Grisha science

414
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:04,899
to transfer this
to someone who can use it?

415
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:07,488
You would give up your gift?

416
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:08,454
Gift?

417
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,913
You dragged me away from my only friends

418
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:14,084
and now, according to you, I'll
be a target for the rest of my life.

419
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:16,583
You know why you've never found
someone with this power?

420
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:18,996
Maybe it's because
they don't want to be found.

421
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:29,298
I'm going to ask you again.

422
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:32,018
Were you tested as a child?

423
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,635
Mal! Alina!

424
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:41,652
We hid.

425
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:45,113
We were different enough already.

426
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,910
Didn't want to be even more alone.

427
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:54,622
You are Grisha.

428
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,294
You are not alone.

429
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:41,541
Why are you back?

430
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,706
We were ambushed. Fjerdans.

431
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:46,795
They must've been close enough
to the Fold to have seen the explosion.

432
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:49,092
They were after her.

433
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:50,969
But where are the others?

434
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:53,722
Dead. Wounded. Waiting on fresh horses.

435
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:57,807
Alina? Is she all right?

436
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:59,272
She is with General Kirigan.

437
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:01,476
You left her alone with one man?

438
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:13,954
We simply cannot afford any more losses.

439
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:22,125
Can we get a small unit to go in?
Look for any survivors?

440
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:23,418
We need to go after her.

441
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,461
Excuse me, soldier?

442
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:33,338
Alina Starkov. The Sun Summoner.

443
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,258
The whole company should be her escort.

444
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:37,266
Everyone will want
her dead or in custody.

445
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,728
Not our problem, son.

446
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:39,728
Not our...

447
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,559
What does that mean?

448
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:44,435
The Sun Summoner is Grisha.

449
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,318
Second Army.

450
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,689
Let those fancy folk handle her.

451
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:51,646
Until they decide she's a fraud
and put her head on a spike,

452
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:53,408
I'm not wasting time or men on it.

453
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:56,079
Until a few hours ago,
she was one of your own.

454
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,489
And you would
turn your back on her so quickly?

455
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:00,789
And they won't kill her.

456
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,631
She's real.

457
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:08,086
I saw it.

458
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:12,221
All I know is she's not worth the risk
until the King tells me so.

459
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:16,553
She's worth it, sir.

460
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:26,484
When I was drafted,
my sergeant schooled us about Grisha.

461
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:31,822
He said we would win this war
because one of them was worth 50 of us.

462
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:36,197
Then the revolver pistol
came in from the west,

463
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:38,952
and I was told
a Grisha was worth two dozen soldiers.

464
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:46,042
When I lost half my company
to the Fjerdans with a repeating rifle

465
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:48,745
and one in ten of our casualties
was Grisha,

466
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:51,506
they said it was an acceptable ratio.

467
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:57,547
How long before they are
just as useless as the rest of us?

468
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:12,775
- Whatever.
- You!

469
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,570
- You heard that, too?
- Was that you?

470
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:20,865
No, I'm, uh...
I'm, uh, bouncing for the Clipper.

471
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,910
Haven't seen you before. Where's Tombar?

472
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:28,496
Oh. Don't know. Hey.
Was that sign damaged before?

473
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:33,463
Saints! Where was that?

474
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:47,812
Boris, would you...

475
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:50,612
It's been a while, Poppy.

476
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,320
I see you're still upset.

477
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,703
About you stealing my shares
of the Crow Club?

478
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,370
It wasn't stealing.
It was just a raw deal.

479
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:02,325
Most deals in the Barrel are.

480
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,865
What do you want, Dirtyhands?

481
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:08,289
I need to find someone.

482
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:12,090
Or at least,
learn how to find them. Tonight.

483
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,800
Looking for a club act, are we?

484
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,471
I'm looking for the Conductor.

485
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:19,553
So you do know him.

486
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:22,597
This is about a job, isn't it?

487
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:27,981
One that sends you all the way east,
for a million kruge?

488
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,980
You'll never make enough
to compete with Pekka, you know?

489
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:33,863
He's a king.
You're just the Bastard of the Barrel.

490
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:44,656
Tante Heleen wrote you?

491
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,544
Just this evening, yes, you snoop.

492
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,461
She was asking
about the Conductor as well.

493
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,330
Probably about the same job.

494
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:53,417
So I warned him to steer clear of her.

495
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:57,218
You warned him? With a note?

496
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:02,298
She wanted you to do that so she
could have the messenger followed.

497
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,218
She wouldn't hurt him, would she?

498
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:08,227
She would if it meant hurting me.

499
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:12,935
Now, if you have any loyalty to him,
tell me where he is. Right now.

500
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,539
Awake? Finally.

501
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:39,012
You hit me.

502
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:41,182
I needed some time.

503
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,339
To ransack my apartment?

504
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,887
To find records of the children
you sold to the brothels.

505
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:47,722
I have never sold any indentures.

506
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:51,846
You sold people to the White Rose.
People like me.

507
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:54,686
You work for Heleen.
No, no, you've got it all wrong.

508
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,442
I'm not in her business, I'm a smuggler.

509
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,994
You steal people.
How many Suli indentures have you sold?

510
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:01,608
I liberate families fleeing the war.

511
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:04,816
I smuggle deserters and refugees.
Please, please!

512
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:07,197
Give me names. Who buys them?

513
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,115
Do you separate the boys from the girls?

514
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:13,207
How old were you when you were taken?

515
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:16,594
Who are you looking for?
Your parents? A sibling?

516
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:19,546
A sister?

517
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:27,008
Brother.

518
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:29,266
He was 12 and I was 14

519
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:31,768
when four men
took us from my parents' wagon,

520
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:32,731
separated us.

521
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,601
I came to Ketterdam
on a labor merchant ship.

522
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:36,858
I don't know where he went.

523
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,150
Tell me what I can do to help.

524
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,740
One had a silver tooth.

525
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:48,033
Went by the name of Gregor or Griggs.

526
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:51,035
I don't run in those circles, really.

527
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,370
You're likely after
longshoremen or stevedores

528
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:55,576
who take side money
from people like Heleen.

529
00:38:56,208 --> 00:39:00,128
If you can't give me a lead,
you can at least give me my freedom.

530
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:01,462
Sankta Lizabeta.

531
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,720
You follow the faith, too.

532
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:07,929
Please.

533
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:09,972
What amount of prayer
can forgive murder?

534
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:12,892
Ask the Saints for me.

535
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,095
Don't!

536
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,819
He's our way to Alina Starkov.

537
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:24,946
Him?

538
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:25,949
Heleen knew it.

539
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,700
She was using you to
sabotage our mission.

540
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:30,033
She and I made a deal.

541
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:33,746
It isn't worth more
than what we get with him alive.

542
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:39,247
You choose him over my freedom?

543
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:42,126
You assume it's one or the other.

544
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:03,944
Conductor. I have a job for you.

545
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:06,904
Get us to the Little Palace.

546
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,247
You'll be safe here.

547
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:24,295
The palace is the most secure building
in the whole country.

548
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:26,716
I made sure of it.

549
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:31,472
Where are you going?

550
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:33,184
Take her to the vezda suite.

551
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:35,222
Am I a prisoner?

552
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:39,097
All of Ravka is.

553
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:42,439
Until you and I have banished the Fold.

554
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:49,412
So no pressure.

555
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:25,314
Mikhael, Dubrov, what are you doing?

556
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:27,024
Keeping a friend from making a mistake.

557
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:28,564
It's not a mistake, she's in danger.

558
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:30,897
She's with the Black General.
Safe as you can get.

559
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:32,283
Not enough for me. Make way.

560
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:33,606
Dubrov's right.

561
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:35,704
Okay, she'll be at the Little Palace
by tomorrow.

562
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,109
Fine, that's where I'll go.

563
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:39,777
What's your plan?
You can't just walk in there, Mal.

564
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,577
That place is filled with people

565
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:44,120
who can kill you
with merely a clean line of sight.

566
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:46,754
You can't get in the gate
without a formal invitation.

567
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:48,172
- Which you don't have.
- Hmm.

568
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:51,710
And you're no good to anyone
if you're hanged as a deserter.

569
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:53,545
Look, you want into the palace?

570
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:56,221
Be a hero. Get a medal.
That will get you invited.

571
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:03,388
Right. Fine, I'll stay.

572
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,888
But only for you.

573
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:07,226
Yeah. Sure.

574
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:10,021
It has nothing to do
with the getting hanged or killed part.

575
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:16,317
I don't get it.

576
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:19,413
She kept her power a secret from him.
Isn't he mad at her?

577
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:22,032
We're all fools, Dubrov.

578
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:27,285
And when our closest friend is
in trouble, we do foolish things.

579
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:32,713
I'm taking her.

580
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:35,505
And when we return,
I'll have the buyout to clear the books.

581
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:37,298
Until then...

582
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:44,175
this is my collateral.

583
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:52,898
What do you have
that could possibly be enough?

584
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:00,446
The Crow Club?

585
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:08,124
Well, I stand corrected.

586
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:12,249
Inej is yours to lose now.

587
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:20,589
It's all yours to lose.
